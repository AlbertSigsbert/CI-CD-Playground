### CI/CD Playground ðŸš€

This repository is a personal sandbox for learning and experimenting with **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Deployment (CD)** practices. It serves as a hands-on guide and a collection of simple projects designed to understand the core concepts of modern software delivery pipelines.

----------

### What is CI/CD?

**Continuous Integration (CI):** The practice of regularly merging all developers' code changes into a central repository. This is followed by automated builds and tests to ensure the changes don't break the application. Think of it as a quality-control checkpoint that runs every time new code is added.

**Continuous Deployment (CD):** The next step after CI. It automates the process of deploying the tested and verified code to a production environment. This allows for rapid and reliable releases.

----------

### What I'm Learning Here

Through the various branches and workflows in this repository, I am focusing on mastering the following concepts:

-   **YAML Syntax:** Understanding the structure and syntax of YAML, which is the foundational language for defining CI/CD workflows.
    
-   **GitHub Actions:** Learning how to create, configure, and manage automated workflows directly within GitHub.
    
-   **Automated Builds & Tests:** Setting up workflows that automatically build an application and run unit/integration tests on every push.
    
-   **Environment Variables & Secrets:** Storing and securely managing sensitive information (like API keys) within CI/CD pipelines.
    
-   **Deployment Strategies:** Exploring basic deployment workflows, such as deploying to a cloud service or a static site host.
    
-   **Workflow Triggering:** Understanding the different events that can trigger a workflow, such as `push`, `pull_request`, or a `schedule`.

### Repository Structure

-   `/`: Root directory for example projects.
    
-   `/.github/workflows/`: This directory contains all the GitHub Actions workflow files (`.yml` files).
    

----------

### Getting Started

You can clone this repository to your local machine to explore the workflow files and experiment with them.

Bash

```
git clone https://github.com/AlbertSigsbert/CI-CD-Playground
cd CI-CD-Playground

```

Feel free to create new branches and test out your own workflow ideas!
